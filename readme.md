Introduction :-<br>
This online compiler project allows users to write, compile, and run code in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. The project also includes features for user authentication, contact us, and more.<br><br>

Features :-<br><br>

Languages Supported :<br>
1. C <br>
2. C++ <br>
3. Java <br>
4. Python <br>
5. JavaScript <br><br>

User Authentication :<br>
1. Sign up: Create a new account to access the online compiler.<br>
2. Sign in: Log in to your existing account to access the online compiler.<br>
3. Sign out: Log out of your account to end your session.<br><br>

Contact Us :<br>
Users can contact us through a contact form or email address.<br><br>

Getting Started :<br>
1. Optional - Sign in to your account or sign up for a new one.<br>
2. Choose the programming language you want to use.<br>
3. Write your code in the editor.<br>
4. Click on the "Run" button to compile and run your code.<br><br>

Sharing Code :<br>
You can share your code with others by pasting and formatting the code into a post.<br><br>

Future Scope :-<br>
1. Cloud Storage for User Programs:<br>
2. In the future, we plan to allow users to save their programs as files in the cloud. This will enable users to:<br>

1. Save their programs and access them later from any device<br>
2. Organize their programs into folders and projectsv
3. Share their programs with others by sharing a link to the file<br>
4. Collaborate with others on projects in real-time<br>
5. To achieve this, we will integrate a cloud storage service such as Google <br>Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3. Users will be able to save their programs to their cloud storage account and access them later by logging in to their account.<br><br>

Additional Features :-<br>
1. We also plan to add the following features in the future:<br>
2. Version control: allow users to track changes to their programs and revert to previous versions if needed<br>
3. Real-time collaboration: allow multiple users to collaborate on a program in real-time<br>
4. Code completion: provide code completion suggestions to users as they type<br>
5. Code analysis: provide code analysis and debugging tools to help users identify errors and improve their code<br>
6. Give users daily quizzes and competitive questions to solve and rank them according to their efficiency<br><br>

Technologies Used :-<br>
1. React js
2. Node js
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Npm Packages
